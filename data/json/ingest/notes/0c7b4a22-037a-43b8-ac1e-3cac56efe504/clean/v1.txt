Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
My visa apply number is 1899427 and my passport number is E12457556. I received a visa refusal from the German Embassy in Beijing .I submitted the appeal paper on December 17, 2018 through the embassy.
I want to know if my appeal is accepted?  what day is the processing time limited?
Sincerely
Yongfeng.Tang(唐永峰）
