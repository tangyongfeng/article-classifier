Count the number of people around you
👨‍👨‍👦
 by monitoring wifi signals
📡
.

howmanypeoplearearound
 calculates the number of people in the vicinity
using the approximate number of smartphones as a proxy (since
~70% of people have smartphones nowadays
).
A cellphone is determined to be in proximity to the computer based on sniffing WiFi probe
requests. Possible uses of
howmanypeoplearearound
 include: monitoring foot traffic in an area
with Raspberry Pis, seeing if your roommates are home, calculate how many people are on the bus, etc.
