<en-note><div>I&apos;m a software engineer who spends most of my time working at a computer.</div><div>There are three parts of my body that make me uneasy.</div><div>1, blood pressure, I have not been concerned about blood pressure, three years ago in Beijing had been warned by the doctor. Until a week ago, I bought a blood pressure monitor and my blood pressure is sometimes very high at night. It reached 152/101 at 23:00 on November 25, and 162/100 at 8:32 on November 27.</div><div><img src="../_resources/IMG_12C48B0B0227-1.jpeg"  hash="778bcdb3c703f6ffce4986ff7a186faa" type="image/jpeg" alt="IMG_12C48B0B0227-1.jpeg" /></en-media><br/></div><div>2,Snoring, I snore very loudly, sometimes all night long. I could not sleep deeply, which made me very sleepy every day. I found out on the internet that this problem can be solv。</div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t drink alcohol, smoke about 3 e-cigarettes every day, and have no other bad habits. Maybe I&apos;ve been under a lot of stress lately and stopped hiking to exercise, but I&apos;m not feeling very well.</div><div><br/></div><div>3,I have very bad breath and I brush my teeth very carefully every day and carry gum with me. Shortly after I eat the gum, I get bad breath, which is a serious problem for me in my work and life.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>
