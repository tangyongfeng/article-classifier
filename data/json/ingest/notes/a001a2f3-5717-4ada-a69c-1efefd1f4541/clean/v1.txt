Hello
I hope someone can help me whit this , that i dont understand, the sap_open() function...
i already make in C115 , c139 and C118 (actually the C118 is not support for latino america) the Hello_world, Layer1  and Rssi,

Im using a Latino american Sim card from Claro and Telefonica..  he provider are actually using GSM 850-1900 MHz.band
Actually im trying to log in the Wireshark the GSM calls, sms and other's stuff to look at it... but when i try to run the "Misc apps " all the apps get me the same error-
****
Failed to connect to '/tmp/osmocom_sap'.
Failed during sap_open(), no SIM reader

****
when i try to find this file is not created.
root <at> cyttek:/opt/cellphone/osmocom-bb/src/host/layer23/src/misc# file /tmp/osmocom_*
 /tmp/osmocom_l2:     socket
/tmp/osmocom_loader: socket
I find that is the file for the process of simcard reader (if im not wrong) .. but actually i didnt find the file its not created..
any one knows whats the problem or how i can dump to wireshark the stuff.?
thanks...
