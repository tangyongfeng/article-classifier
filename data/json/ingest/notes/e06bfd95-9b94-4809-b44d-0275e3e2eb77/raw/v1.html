<en-note><div>I am Chinese. I have just come to Germany and speak English, but German is still learning. I am an IT manager with a very generous salary. I am still living in AirBnB&apos;s apartment. I hope I can move in after I find the house, and then I will move my family to Germany immediately. My wife speaks German, has a son and a daughter, and they are all in Beijing now.</div></en-note>
